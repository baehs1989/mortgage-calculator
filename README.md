# Mortgage Rate Calculator
A Simple Mortgage Rate Calculator can be easily embedded onto external websites as a 3rd party plugin. It will be embedded without causing any conflict as `CSS Modules` is being used to avoid namespace collision for classes.

The app is built with ReactJS with basic dependencies to keep it simple and light. Please refer to `package.json` that will list all dependencies of the app. `core-js` and `regenerator-runtime` are the biggest packages required to support IE. If the app doesn't need to support IE in the future, the packages can be removed, and the app can be lighter.

The widget can be placed at any location within the HTML document. All you have to do is place "\<div id="zuvafetest">\<div>" where the widget needs to be and import required CSS/js files. Please see the examples below. The required CSS/js files can be extracted using the `npm run widget-build` script described in the below section.


```
<header>
    ...
    <link href="./zuvafetest-main.css" rel="stylesheet">
    ...
</header>

<body>
    <div id="zuvafetest">
        <!-- Widget will be rendered here-->
    <div>
    
    ...

    <script defer="defer" src="./zuvafetest-main.js"></script>
</body>
```

        width: 400px;
        height: 600px;
      }
    </style>

    <div class="fixed-parent">

        <div>
    </div>
